# LPEWalkthrough
My walkthrough of the LPEWorkshop exercises

Using the base LPE Workshop from: https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop plus my own custom binaries and scripts (source for those to come later).

Using SharpUp and Seatbelt for Privesc enumeration: https://github.com/GhostPack

Update maybe coming soon using winPEAS.
